it is taken seriously that th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation .
for the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
the features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stridor , dyspnea and cough , which tend to appear at night and in early morning , and in the auscultation finding , the sound is continuous a , especially harmonic flute-like sound .
in addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
it is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed .
the evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condensate measurement , and allergological examination .
the diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
what are important in the clinical diagnosis are , 1 ) that a symptom which derives from air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly , 2 ) that reversibility is shown , at least partially , in the air flow restriction , and 3 ) that other diseases are excluded .
as a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that il-17f gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
pai-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling , and the functional polymorphism of pai-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not .
ccl5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma .
when the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
from the above , the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level .
by making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
